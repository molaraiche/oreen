## The Spark  
Refining my portfolio, I realized real, polished projects speak louder than code snippets. I simulated a client project with:  
- Functional backend  
- Polished UI  
- Production-ready performance  
Following a professional-grade Figma design, my goal was to turn a concept into an agency-ready product.

## The Challenge  
No external client problem pushed this; I set my own benchmark:  
> Build a fast, high-quality app that could serve any small or mid-sized car rental business with minimal branding tweaks.  
Treat it as if a client’s revenue depended on it.
