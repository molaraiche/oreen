# Oreen — Car Rental Web Application

**Overview**  
Oreen is a full-stack car rental web app built to showcase frontend expertise in a real-world context. Designed for scalability, it allows agencies to manage vehicles and bookings while delivering a smooth, intuitive experience for customers.

## The Spark  
Refining my portfolio, I realized real, polished projects speak louder than code snippets. I simulated a client project with:  
- Functional backend  
- Polished UI  
- Production-ready performance  
Following a professional-grade Figma design, my goal was to turn a concept into an agency-ready product.

---

## The Challenge  
No external client problem pushed this; I set my own benchmark:  
> Build a fast, high-quality app that could serve any small or mid-sized car rental business with minimal branding tweaks.  
Treat it as if a client’s revenue depended on it.

## My Role  
- **Position:** Full-stack developer (frontend focus)  
- **Mode:** Solo build  
- **Constraints:** Self-directed, pushing my stack’s limits

---

## Approach & Process  
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15 (App Router), Tailwind CSS, TypeScript  
- **Backend:** Express.js, MongoDB, Axios, Multer (file handling)  
- **Design:** Adapted a high-fidelity Figma design for accessibility and responsiveness  
- **Mindset:** Client-facing polish with clean data architecture and scalable deployment

---

## Key Features  
- Agency dashboard to manage cars and bookings  
- Seamless booking flow for customers  
- Image upload and management for listings  
- Fully responsive design for all devices

---

## The Outcome  
- **Performance:** 90+ Lighthouse score on all key metrics  
- **Reusability:** Easily adaptable for any agency with simple branding tweaks  
- **Quality:** Fast load times, smooth interactions, and a professional UI

---

## Reflection  
This project pushed me to blend frontend polish with backend functionality. It reinforced how small details—like upload flows and booking confirmations—impact real users.  
If revisited, I’d add:  
- Role-based authentication  
- Advanced search filters  
- Analytics dashboards
